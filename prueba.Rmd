## Introduction
We are going to use the following library:
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r loading-libs, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
load("rda/murders.rda")
```

```{r murder-rate-by-state, echo=FALSE}
murders%>%mutate(abb=reorder(abb,rate))%>%
  ggplot(aes(abb,rate))+
  geom_bar(width = 0.5,stat = "identity",color="black")+
  coord_flip()
```
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
